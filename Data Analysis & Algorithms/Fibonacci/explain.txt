java Fibonacci


The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Formula : F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)
Base Case: F(0)=0, F(1)=1

1️⃣ Recursive Method

The recursive method directly uses the mathematical definition.
Logic:

If n <= 1, return n (base case).
Else, return F(n-1) + F(n-2) (recursive case).

Example :-
F(5)
= F(4) + F(3)
= (F(3) + F(2)) + (F(2) + F(1))
= ((F(2) + F(1)) + (F(1) + F(0))) + ((F(1) + F(0)) + F(1))
= (F(1)+F(0)) + F(1) + (F(1) + F(0)) + ((F(1) + F(0)) + F(1))
=   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
=   5 

There is a loop in the main function , which runs for every number from 0 to n and calculates the values then puts them into the series in final output

Speed : Slow for large n
Reliability : Simple but inefficient

2️⃣ Iterative Method

Initial values: prev = 0 , curr = 1

Now we enter the loop (i goes from 2 → 5):
| i | Calculation  | next | prev     | curr     |
| - | ------------ | ---- | -------- | -------- |
| 2 | next = 0 + 1 | 1    | curr → 1 | next → 1 |
| 3 | next = 1 + 1 | 2    | curr → 1 | next → 2 |
| 4 | next = 1 + 2 | 3    | curr → 2 | next → 3 |
| 5 | next = 2 + 3 | 5    | curr → 3 | next → 5 |

F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3), F(4)
Output: 0 1 1 2 3


Speed : Fast and efficient
Reliability : Slightly longer but better performance


Method          Time Complexity                         Reason 
Recursive           O(2ⁿ)                   Each call generates 2 more recursive calls 
                                            (exponential growth).

Iterative           O(n)                    Single loop runs n-2 times.



Method          Space Complexity                       Reason 
Recursive           O(n)                   Due to recursive call stack depth.

Iterative           O(1)                   Uses only 3 integer variables regardless of n.

Applications :-
1. Used in algorithms like Fibonacci Search and Dynamic Programming to optimize recursive solutions and reduce computation time.
2. Helps find correction levels in stock trading.
3. Used to create visually pleasing proportions through the Golden Ratio (≈1.618), which is derived from Fibonacci numbers
4. Seen in flower petals, pinecones, sunflowers, and shell spirals, where the arrangement follows Fibonacci patterns for optimal growth.
