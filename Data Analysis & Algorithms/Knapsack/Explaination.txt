Excellent 👏 we’re now at the **Fractional Knapsack problem**, one of the easiest yet most classic **Greedy algorithm** problems in DAA.

Let’s go step by step exactly like before — I’ll first explain **theory in a beginner-friendly way** (so you can write it in your file + handle viva confidently),
and once you say “next,” we’ll do a **code explanation + output walkthrough** for whichever version you want to run.

# 🧠 Fractional Knapsack Problem — Easy Theory

---

## 🧩 What is the Knapsack problem?

Imagine you are a thief with a **bag (knapsack)** that can carry only a limited weight (say 60 kg).
There are several items available, each with:

* a **value** (profit)
* a **weight**

Your goal:
👉 **maximize the total value you can carry**,
but you cannot exceed the total weight capacity of the bag.

## 🎒 Two types of Knapsack problems

| Type                    | Can we take fractions of items?          | Method               | Example                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **0/1 Knapsack**        | ❌ No (either take full item or leave it) | Dynamic Programming  | Take or skip items                |
| **Fractional Knapsack** | ✅ Yes (can take parts of items)          | **Greedy Algorithm** | You can take half or ¼ of an item |

We are solving the **Fractional Knapsack** version here.

---

## ⚙️ What does “Greedy Method” mean here?

It means:
At each step, **take the item that gives the maximum value per weight unit** (called *value/weight ratio*).
You keep doing this until your bag is full.

So the greedy rule is:

[
\text{Pick items in descending order of } \frac{\text{value}}{\text{weight}}
]

## 💡 Example (simple to understand)

Suppose we have:

| Item | Value | Weight | Value/Weight |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| 1    | 60    | 10     | 6            |
| 2    | 100   | 20     | 5            |
| 3    | 120   | 30     | 4            |

Knapsack capacity = 50

### Step 1: Sort by ratio (v/w)

Order becomes:
Item 1 → 6, Item 2 → 5, Item 3 → 4

### Step 2: Take greedily

| Step                | What we take                           | Remaining capacity | Total value               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Take item 1 (10 kg) | Full                                   | 40                 | 60                        |
| Take item 2 (20 kg) | Full                                   | 20                 | 160                       |
| Take item 3 (30 kg) | Take 20 kg out of 30 kg (2/3 fraction) | 0                  | 160 + 120 × (20/30) = 240 |

✅ **Maximum Value = 240**

## 🧮 Algorithm (step-by-step summary)

1. **Input:** List of `n` items, each with `value` and `weight`, and knapsack capacity `W`.
2. **Compute ratio:** For each item, find `ratio = value / weight`.
3. **Sort items** in **descending order** by ratio.
4. **Initialize** `totalValue = 0`.
5. For each item:

   * If item fits completely (`weight ≤ remaining capacity`)
     → take full item.
   * Else
     → take only the fraction that fits (`value × (remaining capacity / weight)`).
   * Stop when capacity = 0.
6. **Output totalValue** as the maximum profit.

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Step         | Time                             | Reason                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sorting      | O(n log n)                       | Sort items by ratio       |
| Taking items | O(n)                             | One pass through items    |
| **Total**    | **O(n log n)**                   | Dominated by sort         |
| **Space**    | **O(1)** (excluding input array) | Only a few variables used |

## 🧠 Why it’s Greedy & Optimal

* It’s greedy because at every step we make a **locally best choice** (highest value/weight ratio).
* For this problem, greedy gives a **globally optimal** solution (unlike 0/1 Knapsack where it doesn’t always work).

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What is the difference between 0/1 and fractional knapsack? | In fractional we can take parts of items; in 0/1 we cannot.              |
| What is the greedy choice property?                         | Choosing the highest value-to-weight ratio first.                        |
| What is the time complexity?                                | O(n log n)                                                               |
| Why sorting is used?                                        | To arrange items by descending ratio so we can pick the best ones first. |
| Can greedy give optimal solution for 0/1 knapsack?          | No, only for fractional.                                                 |
| What happens if two items have same ratio?                  | You can take either first — total value will be same.                    |

✅ **Summary you can write in your journal file**

**Aim:**
To solve the fractional knapsack problem using the greedy method.

**Algorithm:**

1. Compute value/weight ratio for each item.
2. Sort items in decreasing order of ratio.
3. Take items until capacity allows; if remaining capacity < item weight, take fractional part.
4. Calculate total value.

**Output:**
Maximum value that can be obtained.

**Complexity:**
Time = O(n log n), Space = O(1).
