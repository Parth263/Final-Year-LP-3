We solve this using backtracking:-
1. Place one queen per row.
2. For each row, try placing a queen in a column that’s safe.
3. If you get stuck, backtrack (remove the previous queen) and try a new column.

        // Check upper-left diagonal
        for (int i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--)

        Each step up-left means:
        Move one row up (row index decreases by 1)
        Move one column left (column index decreases by 1)

        This ensures that both indices stay within the board boundaries:
        i >= 0 → we haven’t gone above the top row.
        j >= 0 → we haven’t gone past the leftmost column.

        //board[row][col] = 0;
    If the recursive call returns false, it means:

    “Placing a queen at (row, col) eventually led to a dead end —
    I couldn’t finish placing the rest.”

    So, we remove the queen from (row, col) — set it back to 0.

    This step is called backtracking

    IN SIMPLE TERMS:-
    “Try every possible column in this row.
    If one works, move to the next row.
    If the next row gets stuck, come back here, remove your queen,
    and try another column.
    Keep doing this until either all rows are filled (success) or all possibilities fail (no solution).”

    if (solveNQueens(row + 1)) {last line}
    it’s confirming that the entire rest of the board (all rows below)
    can be filled without any conflicts


ALGORITHM:-
Step 1:
Start with an empty N × N chessboard (all cells initialized to 0).
Step 2:
Place the fixed queen at the given position (fixedRow, fixedCol) by setting
board[fixedRow][fixedCol] = 1.
Step 3:
Call the recursive function solveNQueens(row = 0) to begin placing queens starting from the first row.

Recursive Function: solveNQueens(row)
1️⃣ If row == N
 → All queens are placed successfully, so return true.
2️⃣ If row == fixedRow
 → Skip this row (since a queen is already placed) and call
  solveNQueens(row + 1).
3️⃣ For each column col = 0 to N - 1:
  a. Check if position (row, col) is safe using the isSafe() function.
  b. If safe, place a queen there:
    board[row][col] = 1
  c. Recursively call solveNQueens(row + 1)
    - If recursion returns true → solution found → return true.
  d. Else, remove the queen (backtrack):
    board[row][col] = 0
4️⃣ If no column is safe in this row → return false (trigger backtracking).

Function: isSafe(row, col)
To check if a queen can be placed at (row, col):
1️⃣ Check all rows above the current row in the same column.
 If any has a queen → return false.
2️⃣ Check the upper-left diagonal (i--, j--).
 If any cell has a queen → return false.
3️⃣ Check the upper-right diagonal (i--, j++).
 If any cell has a queen → return false.
4️⃣ If no conflicts found → return true.

Step 4:
After the recursive call,
If solveNQueens(0) returns true → print the board as the final N-Queens matrix.
Else → display “No solution exists for this placement.”
